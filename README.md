## Installation
This plugin should be installed within the ```mu-plugins``` directory. Once installed, you can configure, as defined below.

## About
This plugin allows you to define a new login endpoint within wp-config to protect wp-login from bot attacks. It can also be used on development sites to stop bots from visiting. Once installed, set the following within wp-config.php.

```PHP
define( 'BML_ENDPOINT', 'your-endpoint' );
```

This will redirect anyone that tries to access wp-login.php or /wp-admin, back to the site's homepage, if not logged in. Only visiting /your-endpoint will work properly. To restrict access on development sites from bots or general access, you can also define the following within wp-config.php, but with options. If you set:

```PHP
define( 'BML_ALLOWED', true );
```

When visiting, users will be sent to builtmighty.com. Users can visit the site URL, with the appended query parameters (example.com/?bml=true), and have a 24-hour cookie set to allow access to the site. You can also define allowed IPs, instead of setting the value to true, like so:

```PHP
define( 'BML_ALLOWED', [ '123.123.123.123' ] );
```
