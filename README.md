<p align="center" style="font-size:42px !important;">🚀 Built Mighty Kit</p>

## About
This plugin is the all-around kit for Built Mighty client sites. From defining a new login endpoint for security, to protecting wp-login from bot attacks, adding two-factor authentication for admins, and disabling email sending on development sites, this plugin should provide you with the tools for a happy, healthy environment. If you have additional tools you'd like to see added, please either open an issue or contact one of the lead devs by tagging '@lead-dev-team' on Slack.

## Tools/Features
#### Security
* **Two-Factor Authentication** &mdash; *(optional)* Adds Two-Factor Authentication for `administrators` when enabled, but can be applied to other user roles. Uses email authentication by default, but also provides app-based authentication options.
* **Site Access** &mdash; *(optional)* Blocks access to the site when not logged in as an administrator, by redirecting non-logged in users to builtmighty.com.
* **Login URL** &mdash; *(optional)* Creates a custom login URL, while making the default WordPress login inaccessible. Trying to access the default login will redirect you to the homepage.
* **WordPress Version** &mdash; Removes the WordPress version from the head to better obfuscate from attackers.
* **User Enumeration** &mdash; Blocks WordPress user enumeration via the WordPress API.
* **Theme/Plugin Editor** &mdash; *(optional)* Disables the theme and plugin editors on the backend of WordPress.

#### Development Environments
* **WP Mail** &mdash; *(optional)* Blocks outgoing emails by setting the "to" email address as `developers@builtmighty.com`. Enabled by default on development and staging environments.
* **External Requests** &mdash; *(optional)* Blocks external API requests, but with the feature to allow connections to specific domains. Enabled by default on development and staging environments, but with default access to: `api.wordpress.org`, `downloads.wordpress.org`, `github.com`, `github.dev`, `github.io`, `githubusercontent.com`, `slack.com`, and `builtmighty.com`.
* **Action Scheduler** &mdash; *(optional)* Disables the Action Scheduler from running. Enabled by default on development and staging environments.

#### Misc.
* **Slack Connection** &mdash; *(optional)* Adds a Slack integration that allows both clients to contact us via their Slack channel and allows us to create WordPress settings notifications.
* **Plugin/Theme Updates** &mdash; Adds a warning message about updating themes and plugins on production sites.
* **Plugin/Theme Installs** &mdash; Adds a warning message about installing themes and plugins on production sites.
* **WordPress Heartbeat** &mdash; Adjusts WordPress' heartbeat settings for more efficiency.
* **Post Revisions** &mdash; Adjusts the number of saved post revisions for more efficiency and less bloat.
* **Dashboard Widgets** &mdash; Removes junk dashboard widgets, which slow the backend of WordPress.
* **Action Scheduler** &mdash; Adjusts the Action Scheduler log retention period to five (5) days, for less bloat.
* **Development Footer** &mdash; Adds `🔨 Proudly developed by Built Mighty` to the wp-admin footer.
* **Developer Widget** &mdash; Adds a Built Mighty developer dashboard widget, with: PHP version, MySQL version, WordPress version, WooCommerce version (if installed), enabled services, and the current Git branch.
* **Client Widget** &mdash; Adds a client dashboard widget with welcome information, as well as a Slack message form.
* **Delete Users Search** &mdash; *(optional)* Replaces the "Attribute all content to" drop-down on the Delete Users screen, which loads every account on the site, with a capped list plus a paginated search, and explains what "Delete all content" would actually remove. Enabled by default.

## Installation on All Sites
It is highly recommended that, no matter the site, the `WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE` variable should be set within `wp-config.php`. The plugin will automatically detect a development site via the URL, but sites can also be placed into development mode using the environment variable. Set the variable to: `local`, `development`, or `staging`, to set the plugin in development mode. Set the environment variable to `production` to set the plugin to production mode.

## Settings
To edit the settings of the plugin, once logged in, go to `/wp-admin/admin.php?page=builtmighty`.
