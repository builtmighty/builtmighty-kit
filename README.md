## Installation on All Sites
It is highly recommended that no matter the site, the WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE variable should be set within wp-config.php. The plugin will automatically detect a development site via the URL, but sites can also be placed into development mode using the environment variable. Set the variable to: `local`, `development`, or `staging`, to set the plugin in development mode. Set the environment variable to `production`, to set the plugin to production mode.

## Constants
The following constants can be set within wp-config.php for each site, in order to enable/disable some optional features/tools.

`define( 'WP_ENVIRONMENT_TYPE', 'development' );`
*(options: local, development, staging, production)*
This variable should be set on **all** sites. It greatly determines how the plugin operates and what options are available. It also is a global, WordPress constant that can be used by other plugins.

`define( 'BUILT_ENDPOINT', 'access' );`
This variable sets the custom login endpoint for the site. If this is not set, the feature will not be enable. If set, the new login will be the second parameter and any attempts to access wp-admin or wp-login.php, while not logged in, will send the user to the home page.

`define( 'BUILT_ACCESS', true );`
This constant disables access to the site, unless the user is logged in. The login URL is still accessible, either the custom or default, but not other URLs are accessible.

`define( 'BUILT_2FA', true );`
If this is set to true, then two factor authentication is enabled for all administrators. Upon logging in initially, all admins will be forced to set up two factor authentication.

`define( 'BUILT_2FA_SETTINGS', true );`
This variable turns on 2FA for all sensitive settings on the site, which means admins with two factor authentication set up must provide a code in order to view the settings. Additional blocked/sensitive settings can be set within the Built Mighty menu item, which is only accessible by users with @builtmighty.com or @littlerhino.io email addresses.

`define( 'BUILT_LOCKDOWN', true );`
If set to true, then only approved IPs (approved by 2FA, other admins, or CLI commands) can access the site.
